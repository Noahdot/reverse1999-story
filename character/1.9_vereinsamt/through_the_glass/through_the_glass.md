## Preface. The World of Yesterday

> *What is lurking in the mirror? Grief.*
>
> *What is stirring beyond the wall? Calamity.*
>
> *—Anna Akhmatova*

**Kakania:**　　Just so ...

**Kakania:**　　Look, it's no harder than tying a sailor's hitch.

**Kakania:**　　* exhale *

**Kakania:**　　Maybe, it can protect us from this disaster.

**Kakania:**　　...

**Kakania:**　　Yes, right.

**Kakania:**　　It is as simple as this, right.

**Kakania:**　　...

> *She holds up the knot in her hand.*
>
> *But there are no cheers of jubilation.*
>
> *Despite the knots in their hands, the people around her have all started to melt away in the rising rain.*

**Kakania:**　　...

> *Eyes empty, she ignores the researcher's tentative advice and continues to grasp the shard in her palm.*
>
> *It's a shard of mirror.*

**Kakania:**　　* deep breath *

> *Her mirror shattered during the "Storm." This is one piece of it.*
>
> *But she can't recall who broke it.*
>
> *Perhaps it was some frantic passerby or simply herself.*
>
> *Kakania fights against her impulse to grasp the shard even tighter. There is already a cut in her hand. It would be best not to make it deeper.*
>
> *The Foundation made a mistake. They failed to check her handbag for any dangerous items.*

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　Ma'am, the Foundation will accept you as a refugee in accordance with the "Storm" Act.

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　And according to Article 43, Section 2, of the Act, "If a person has survived the 'Storm' with no obvious side effects, they will be put under quarantine control."

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　It also says, "Under special circumstances, ask a member of staff involved in immunity protection production to intervene."

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　So ...

**Kakania:**　　...

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　So we've invited Madam Lucy, the lead of immunity equipment production, to come speak with you. Please put down the sharp object and wait—
