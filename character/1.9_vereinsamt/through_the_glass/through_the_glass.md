## Preface. The World of Yesterday

> *What is lurking in the mirror? Grief.*
>
> *What is stirring beyond the wall? Calamity.*
>
> *—Anna Akhmatova*

**Kakania:**　　Just so ...

**Kakania:**　　Look, it's no harder than tying a sailor's hitch.

**Kakania:**　　* exhale *

**Kakania:**　　Maybe, it can protect us from this disaster.

**Kakania:**　　...

**Kakania:**　　Yes, right.

**Kakania:**　　It is as simple as this, right.

**Kakania:**　　...

> *She holds up the knot in her hand.*
>
> *But there are no cheers of jubilation.*
>
> *Despite the knots in their hands, the people around her have all started to melt away in the rising rain.*

**Kakania:**　　...

> *She is the only survivor. Her arm drops to her lap, and she looks absently at the knot in her hand.*
>
> *This is the only thing she could do.*

## Part 01. Tristan Chord

**Kakania:**　　...

**Laplace Researcher:**　　Ma'am, listen.

**Laplace Researcher:**　　Can you please put that down first?

**Kakania:**　　...

> *Eyes empty, she ignores the researcher's tentative advice and continues to grasp the shard in her palm.*
>
> *It's a shard of mirror.*

**Kakania:**　　* deep breath *

> *Her mirror shattered during the "Storm." This is one piece of it.*
>
> *But she can't recall who broke it.*
>
> *Perhaps it was some frantic passerby or simply herself.*
>
> *Kakania fights against her impulse to grasp the shard even tighter. There is already a cut in her hand. It would be best not to make it deeper.*
>
> *The Foundation made a mistake. They failed to check her handbag for any dangerous items.*

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　Ma'am, the Foundation will accept you as a refugee in accordance with the "Storm" Act.

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　And according to Article 43, Section 2, of the Act, "If a person has survived the 'Storm' with no obvious side effects, they will be put under quarantine control."

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　It also says, "Under special circumstances, ask a member of staff involved in immunity protection production to intervene."

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　So ...

**Kakania:**　　...

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　So we've invited Madam Lucy, the lead of immunity equipment production, to come speak with you. Please put down the sharp object and wait—

> *She's interrupted by the clanging of steel footsteps and a voice from outside the room.*

**Lucy:**　　I have been informed that I am needed here.

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　Madam Lucy! That was quick.

**Kakania:**　　Hm?

**Kakania:**　　Madam Lucy. Is that you?

> *The footsteps grow steadily louder until Madam Lucy is standing squarely in the doorframe.*

**Lucy:**　　Yes. It is me. And you are ...

> *Her scanning process finishes within a second.*

**Lucy:**　　Ms. Klara Vingler.

**Kakania:**　　That's right!

**Kakania:**　　We've only heard each other over the phone. I'm impressed you recognized me so easily!

**Lucy:**　　Your name is written on the end of the bed.

> *She points to the name tag. She had simply scanned the room.*

**Kakania:**　　Oh, the name card. Of course. Haha.

> *The staff member nods and passes the file to Lucy.*

**Foundation Staff Member I:**　　I'll leave her to you then, madam. And please be wary of the glass shard in her hand.

**Lucy:**　　Not to worry. A shard of glass cannot harm me.

> *She reaches out a shiny hand to Kakania.*

**Lucy:**　　It is a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Vingler. You are the only one who made the knot and successfully survived the "Storm." I have many questions for you.

**Lucy:**　　Especially about your condition, side effects, and what it felt like in the throes of the "Storm."

**Lucy:**　　However, due to my suspension from Laplace, my colleagues will carry out the querying for me. Your answers will be of significant help to my research.

**Lucy:**　　As a time-traveler, you must have many questions for us as well. I will try my best to answer them for you.
